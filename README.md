# AutomaticBallsStrikes
Here I did two analyses, in regards to the implementation of the Automatic Balls Strikes (ABS) challenge system next year. One finds the most miscalled pitches by umpires (as compared to ABS) and plots them (ABS_analysis.ipynb). The other is a Monte Carlo Simulation to determine the optimal times to use ABS challenges (ABS_monte_carlo.ipynb).
